# Competitive programming contests website
# **Codeforces Clone Project Roadmap**

## **Project Overview**

We are building a Codeforces-like platform to host competitive programming competitions at our university. The platform will include:

- A **home page** with active competitions and recent problems.
- A **problem set** where users can view and solve problems.
- A **competition system** to host real-time programming contests.
- A **submission system** to evaluate user code and provide results.
